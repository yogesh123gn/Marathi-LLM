# Marathi-LLM

## Overview
**Marathi-LLM** is an open-source project aimed at developing a robust Large Language Model (LLM) capable of understanding and generating content in the Marathi language. The goal is to bridge the gap in AI-driven tools that support regional languages, providing native Marathi speakers with a conversational AI that truly understands the nuances of the language. The model can be adapted for various use cases, from chatbots and sentiment analysis to translation and content generation.

## Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles Marathi as well as code-mixed Marathi-English (Hinglish) conversations.
- **Text Generation**: Generates contextually appropriate Marathi text for various domains like storytelling, poetry, and customer support.
- **Translation**: Translates text between Marathi and English while preserving context and tone.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes sentiment from Marathi social media posts, customer feedback, or reviews.
- **Voice Integration (Planned)**: Future integration for voice-to-text and text-to-voice capabilities in Marathi.
- **Knowledge Base**: Can be used for answering domain-specific queries, like agriculture-related questions for farmers in Marathi.

## Why Marathi-LLM?
Despite the growing popularity of AI in conversational applications, there is a lack of models that can truly cater to the nuances of regional languages like Marathi. Marathi-LLM aims to:
- Make AI more accessible to Marathi speakers.
- Preserve cultural heritage through AI-generated stories, poems, and dialogues.
- Enable developers to create Marathi-centric applications with minimal effort.
